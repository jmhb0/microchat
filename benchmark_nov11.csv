Question:
'''Why does the resolution of the same cryo-EM image decrease when the sample is exposed to a high cumulative dose of electrons?'''

Answer:
```The dosage affects final resolution because as high-energy electrons interact with the atoms in the sample, this causes ionization and breaking of chemical bonds and a consequent rearrangement of chemical bonds. As a result, the fine details are lost and the raw data may not adequately reflect the original structure. So as cumulative dose increases, this will cause more damage to the sample and more of the samples atoms will ionize and the final resolution will be lower. ```",Why does the resolution of the same cryo-EM image decrease when the sample is exposed to a high cumulative dose of electrons?,"The dosage affects final resolution because as high-energy electrons interact with the atoms in the sample, this causes ionization and breaking of chemical bonds and a consequent rearrangement of chemical bonds.

Question:
'''What are some strategies used to mitigate the effects of radiation damage during cryo-EM imaging?'''


Answer:
``` One key approach is low-dose imaging, where a low electron dose is used to minimize radiation damage, carefully balancing the need for signal against the risk of damage. Dose fractionation is another method, involving the collection of multiple frames at lower doses and then averaging them, reducing the overall dose while still capturing sufficient information for high-quality reconstruction.

Answer:
```Multiple possible answers. One is the abnormal circular morphology of the cristae. Cristae morphology reflects the mitochondria’s capacity for energy production through oxidative phosphorylation as the shape and surface area of the cristae determines the diffusion patterns of ions, metabolites, and proteins and governs the assembly and stability of electron transport chain complexes. The abnormal circular cristae morphology may indicate deficiency in energy output that is present in mitochondrial diseases. ```",What about this image indicates a diseased state?,"Multiple possible answers.

'''Ok, so these cellular structures must be mitochondria. Why is the signal so unevenly distributed throughout the neuronal cell and why isn’t there a signal coming from the nucleus?'''


Answer:
```The fluorescently-tagged protein is likely being directed to mitochondria. These are organelles located the cytoplasm of cells. Mitochondria in neurons do not form a continuous organelle throughout the whole cell but rather form separate entities that regularly move around in the cell, and split and fuse with each other. These dynamics processes are important to maintain mitochondrial health and to enable mitochondria to reach far flung places in the neuron.```","Ok, so these cellular structures must be mitochondria.

Question:
'''How can I experimentally disrupt the distribution of mitochondria in cells?'''


Answer:
```Mitochondria require microtubules and motor proteins to ensure their distribution throughout the cell. Acutely disrupting the microtubule network with taxol or nocodazole, or genetically interfering with the expression of motor proteins, such as kinesin-1 (KIF5) will affect the distribution of mitochondria throughout the cell. However, both microtubules and motor proteins regulate the distribution of many other organelles. Mitochondrial distribution can be studied more specifically by interfering with the mitochondrial fusion and fission cycles. For instance, genetically interfering with the expression of proteins involved in mitochondrial fission, such as Mitochondrial fission factor (Mff) or fusion, such as Mitofusin-1 and -2 (Mfn1/2) will alter the distribution of mitochondria in neurons.```",How can I experimentally disrupt the distribution of mitochondria in cells?,"Mitochondria require microtubules and motor proteins to ensure their distribution throughout the cell.

'''Why do mitochondria look smaller in the more distant neuronal processes compared to the mitochondria located in the thicker processes closer to the cell body?'''


Answer:
```A defining feature of mitochondrial distribution in neurons is that mitochondria are longer and their density is higher in dendrites compared to the axon.

Answer:
```You could try to recruit a confirmed healthy donor and investigate in a paired experiment whether his sperm cells also show a similar number of spontaneously acrosome reacted cells. Also you could check the literature for numbers of spontaneously acrosome reacted cells in capacitated sperm from healthy fertile men and compare to your patient by determining the number of acrosome reacted cells.

Question:
'''Why might this have occurred?'''


Answer:
```There are several reasons why a confocal microscopy image might be out of focus. In this case, spherical aberration is a likely cause, since the center of the images is in focus while the upper and lower parts are not. Spherical aberration causes light rays from different parts of the field to focus at different points along the z-axis, and occurs when there is a mismatch in the refractive indices of the immersion medium, the coverslip, and the sample. One common practice that may lead to this is imaging a sample directly after retrieving it from cold storage, such as the refrigerator, which causes condensation to accumulate on the sample lid. ```",Why might this have occurred?,"There are several reasons why a confocal microscopy image might be out of focus.

Answer:
```To test whether the mitotic increase in MERCs corresponds to an increase in Ca2+ transfer, you could utilise a Ca2+ indicator protein such as Calcium-measuring organelle-Entrapped Protein IndicAtors (CEPIA) targeted to the mitochondria and the ER or cytosol. CEPIA emit red, green, or blue fluorescence, which can be quantified in a live-cell imaging system like Incucyte.

Answer:
```If you are studying cultured cells, a method to increase the number of cycling cells at the time when you are fixing and investigating the cells, may be to synchronize the cell culture and time the fixation of the sample right at the time when most cells undergo mitosis. Note that the cell seeding density plays also a role in how many cells undergo mitosis. For example, some epithelial cell types are contact-inhibited when becoming too dense, meaning that they do no longer divide when they are surrounded by other cells. Furthermore, a shortage of nutrients may play a role in how fast cells cycle. Note that these were just few aspects influencing mitosis. There are many factors that influence mitosis.```",I cannot find other dividing cells in my sample.

Answer:
```Antibody aggregates may lie on top of the cell. Since they are enormously bright, they often are also visible from of-focus planes.

Question:
'''But I used confocal microscopy. How is it possible that I see an out-of-focus signal?'''


Answer:
```Confocal microscopy allows optical sectioning a sample but is still limited in z resolution. The resolution is, due to the nature of the point-spread-function of light in a lense system, always lower in the axial (z) direction than in the lateral (x,y) direction. To further explore this, you could calculate the optical section that you acquire from the specifications of your microscope setup. Another important point to consider is that the brighter an object in a confocal microscope setup the more of-focus blur appears in of-focus planes compared to the object. Note that the pinhole cannot remove all of focus blur, but just largely reduces the of-focus light. A very bright object like an antibody aggregate may thus show more of-focus light than the other stained objects.```",But I used confocal microscopy.

```There are multiple options that you can try, albeit it is not guaranteed that they will help. You could optimize the concentration of applied antibodies, and lower the concentration.

'''I investigated the culture. Even though this culture is fixed with PFA 4%, the structures move a lot. I am concluding that the bacteria are alive. How is it possible? Are they resistant to PFA?'''


Answer:
```You could consider that the bacteria may have entered into your culture after it was fixed. It is very unlikely that bacteria are resistant to paraformaldehyde fixation since they contain proteins that would be crosslinked by paraformaldehyde, which, in turn, would lead to death of the bacterium.```","I investigated the culture.

Answer:
```This is difficult to find out, but you could try different strategies to confirm that this is likely cellular debris. I can provide some examples. First, you could try to exclude that these are bacteria. If this is a live cell culture, you would see that bacteria move much more and become more over time. If these are bacteria, a staining with a DNA-dye like DAPI or Hoechst should strongly stain them. There are more options to check whether these are bacteria. Second, you could try to stain this culture with antibodies or dyes for very common proteins in the cell type you are studying, like Tubulin, Actin, or an ER marker, and check whether these label these structures. In any case, if these are bacteria, you should see highly repetitive staining patterns in all of them, such as that all of them stain for DAPI. Cellular debris is likely less predictable in content and would probably not provide the same staining in all debris particles, when stained for certain common proteins.```",How could I find out whether this is cellular debris?,"This is difficult to find out, but you could try different strategies to confirm that this is likely cellular debris.

Question:
'''If it was not cytoplasmic bodies that are stained, what other subcellular structures may present with a similar staining pattern? And what distinguishes them from a cytoplasmic bodies staining pattern?'''


Answer:
```Vesicles or small lipid droplets may also give rise to spotty staining pattern. However, the number of spots you are seeing in the cell and their distribution as well as relatively uniform size and brightness points much more to a cytoplasmic bodies than a lipid droplet staining. The same applies to vesicular staining patterns.

Additional information:
'''The microscopy images of cultured human A-430 cells show significant single-cell heterogeneity in the staining for the protein CCNB1. This variability can be attributed to differences in CCNB1 levels among the cells, likely influenced by factors such as the metabolic state of individual cells and their respective phases in the cell cycle. The observed differences in nuclear shape and size correlate with the intensity of the CCNB1 signal in the cytoplasm, indicating that the cells are indeed in various stages of the cell cycle, which may modulate CCNB1 levels.'''
Question:
'''How could I further test the hypothesis that CCNB1 protein levels are related to the cell cycle position.'''


Answer:
```There are several options to test this hypothesis, some of which I can suggest. First, you could try to synchronize your cells before seeding them into your experiment, e.g., with a mitotic shake-off, and compare cells that were fixed at different time points after seeding. Second, you may introduce the transgenic Fucci reporter into your cells, which reports the cell cycle stage based on green / red fluorescent protein expression, and in the next step conduct a time course experiment, and validate that cytoplasmic CCNB1 level align with the cell cycle. Third, you may transgenically modify CCNB1 with a fluorophore and conduct a long-term live cell imaging experiment which allows you to follow cells over an entire cell cycle and would allow you to observe CCNB1 behavior during the cell cycle.```",How could I further test the hypothesis that CCNB1 protein levels are related to the cell cycle position.,"There are several options to test this hypothesis, some of which I can suggest.

Answer:
```You may see a centrosome stain in the nucleus even though the centrosome is outside of the cell when  the focal plane recorded is at the edge of the nucleus. The Z (axial) resolution of a confocal microscope is generally much worse than the XY (lateral) resolution. In your image the green spot may look like it was in the nucleus but it actually may be placed on top of the nucleus. Focusing on your image you may notice that the spot in the top cell is a bit out of focus, confirming this hypothesis.```","How can it be a centrosome staining, when I see green spots within the nucleus in the cell in the top middle of the image and in the cell in the middle left of the image?","You may see a centrosome stain in the nucleus even though the centrosome is outside of the cell when  the focal plane recorded is at the edge of the nucleus.

'''What would the results look like if we adjusted the treatment and changed the concentration of 30 μM ciclopirox to 50 μM ciclopirox instead?'''


Answer:
```Ciclopirox seems to be causing stress, making the mitochondria undergo excessive fission which results in the fragmentation. If the ciclopirox concentration is increased, we may expect that the mitochondria undergo even more fission which would result in a greater amount of fragmented earlier on. Additionally, the mitochondrial health would greatly suffer as energy production is also disrupted.```",What would the results look like if we adjusted the treatment and changed the concentration of 30 μM ciclopirox to 50 μM ciclopirox instead?,"Ciclopirox seems to be causing stress, making the mitochondria undergo excessive fission which results in the fragmentation.

Question:
'''What is the STING pathway and what processes is it involved in?'''


Answer:
``` The STING pathway is important for several processes such as inflammation, apoptosis, autophagy and interferon (IFN) responses. Normally, it’s in the ER but once activated, it binds to cyclic-GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) which creates a second messenger, 2′3′-cGAMP. This binds to STING and changes its conformation, causing it to move from the ER to Golgi. There, TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) phosphorylates STING which activates the transcription factors which eventually cause transcription of cytokine genes.```",What is the STING pathway and what processes is it involved in?,"The STING pathway is important for several processes such as inflammation, apoptosis, autophagy and interferon (IFN) responses.

```The variation in density fit between the two CryoEM maps could be influenced by factors such as the resolution differences, where higher resolution maps like in {img_0} provide more accurate atomic detail, and lower resolution maps like in {img_1} result in a less precise fit. This results in the density fitting to a more globular shape around small sidechains like Tyrosine, but higher resolution maps are able to capture them quite well. .Other contributing factors might include cumulative electron dose being over 1.5e/A^2, which can cause radiation damage and degrade the map quality, sample preparation differences like using a gold grid instead of copper, and variations in imaging conditions, such as beam intensity and exposure time.```",What are the possible mechanisms that could contribute to the variation in density fit between the two CryoEM maps?,"The variation in density fit between the two CryoEM maps could be influenced by factors such as the resolution differences, where higher resolution maps like in {img_0} provide more accurate atomic detail, and lower resolution maps like in {img_1} result in a less precise fit.

Question:
'''How might changes in the Cryo-EM imaging process, such as electron dose or imaging time, lead to differences in the mesh density observed around the same atomic model?'''


Answer:
```Higher electron doses can lead to increased radiation damage to the sample, resulting in structural alterations and degradation of the electron density, due to the flux of high-energy electrons causing ionization and rearranging or breaking chemical bonds, specifically in sidechains or rotameric regions. This may cause a more diffuse mesh density in the resulting map, as the fine details of the atomic structure are lost, especially in sidechain atoms like Tyrosine, as shown in the images, particularly shown in {img_1}. Longer imaging times can also lead to cumulative electron exposure, which can further exacerbate radiation damage, and further damage the map, leading to bad electron density fitting. This can result in a loss of resolution and clarity in the mesh density, leading to a less defined appearance around the model.```","How might changes in the Cryo-EM imaging process, such as electron dose or imaging time, lead to differences in the mesh density observed around the same atomic model?","Higher electron doses can lead to increased radiation damage to the sample, resulting in structural alterations and degradation of the electron density, due to the flux of high-energy electrons causing ionization and rearranging or breaking chemical bonds, specifically in sidechains or rotameric regions.

Answer:
```In the 2.63Å map in {img_1}, the diffuse density appears less defined than expected for this resolution, which typically should provide clearer structural details. This definition results in a poor globular fit around the atom, compared to the 1.34Å map in {img_0} which fits to the shape of the aromatic Tyrosine quite well. This unusual characteristic indicates potential issues such as increased radiation damage or insufficient electron dose, which can lead to a loss of resolution and clarity, wehre the dosage increases per frame of 1.5e/Å^2.

Question:
'''What is unusual about the local resolution distribution in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in {img_0}, and why is this significant for structural analysis?'''


Answer:
```The unusual aspect of the local resolution distribution in the RBD, as seen in {img_0}, is that the RBD exhibits lower local resolution (indicated by red in the image) compared to other regions of the spike protein that are indicated by other colors. This is significant because it suggests that the RBD is more flexible or mobile, making it challenging to resolve at high resolution, and therefore have less visible structural details. This flexibility could impact how well the RBD is modeled and understood, which is critical for designing therapeutics targeting this region.```","What is unusual about the local resolution distribution in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in {img_0}, and why is this significant for structural analysis?","The unusual aspect of the local resolution distribution in the RBD, as seen in {img_0}, is that the RBD exhibits lower local resolution (indicated by red in the image) compared to other regions of the spike protein that are indicated by other colors.

Answer:
```The RBD shown in {img_0} might exhibit lower local resolution because it is a highly flexible region of the spike protein, capable of adopting multiple conformations as it interacts with the ACE2 receptor on host cells. This flexibility results in averaging out the electron density during reconstruction, leading to lower local resolution as shown in the image.

Answer:
```One limitation of using tomograms from {img_0} is the potential for motion blur due to the dynamic nature of the virions embedded in vitreous ice, which can obscure fine structural details. Additionally, the inherent challenges of resolving individual viral components within the dense background of the surrounding ice can lead to difficulties in accurately interpreting the morphology of the virions.

Answer:
```While ASLV particles are known to be pleomorphic, some of the densities seen here correspond to normal gold fiducials (and corresponding ‘back-projection reconstruction streaks’, which are ‘ghosts’ or ‘shadows’ of gold fiducials extending to slices beyond the actual location of the fiducials in z), as well as features of the carbon support (the linear diagonal density in the bottom-right corner suggests this is a ‘lacey carbon’ specimen support grid).

Question:
'''Assuming you are correct, how would you expect the expression of this protein to differ in a healthy liver tissue compared to the tissue in this image? '''


Answer:
```Answer 1: A healthy tissue might express lower levels of this protein, as cancerous tissue such as the one in the image often induces the formation of new blood vessels to supply oxygen and nutrients to rapidly growing cells. Endothelial proteins involved in this process, such as those regulating vascular permeability, might then be overexpressed to accommodate the increased demands of the tumor microenvironment. 
Answer 2: A healthy tissue might express higher levels of this protein, as a protein that maintains vascular integrity of normal endothelial cells might be downregulated in cancerous tissue. A reduction in the expression of barrier-protective proteins could contribute to the leakiness of tumor-associated vasculature, promoting metastasis and immune cell infiltration. ```","Assuming you are correct, how would you expect the expression of this protein to differ in a healthy liver tissue compared to the tissue in this image?

Question:
'''How does the histamine stimulation affect the Ca2+ transfer in the silenced cells compared to the not silenced and how can we draw that conclusion?'''


Answer:
```The histamine stimulation causes an increase in Ca2+ transfer in the non-silenced cells, but only none to slight in the silenced ones. Since the cells are in Ca2+ deficient media, histamine triggers release of Ca2+ from internal deposits. The increased Ca2+ availability causes an increase in the expression of calmodulin, a protein that mediates the effects of Ca2+ and which when fused to RFP gives a red fluorescent signal.```",How does the histamine stimulation affect the Ca2+ transfer in the silenced cells compared to the not silenced and how can we draw that conclusion?,"The histamine stimulation causes an increase in Ca2+ transfer in the non-silenced cells, but only none to slight in the silenced ones.

```Pyroptosis is normally mediated by the canonical NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. Triggered by danger signals, NLRP3 forms a complex with the effector caspase-1.Activated caspase-1 proteolytically converts pro-IL1β into its active form which induces pyroptosis through cleavage of gasdermin D. Gasdermin D forms pores that lead to membrane rupture and release of pro-inflammatory mediators that exacerbate inflammation.```",What pathways may have been activated to cause this?,"Pyroptosis is normally mediated by the canonical NLRP3 inflammasome pathway.

Question:
'''The cell in the middle right seems to have two nuclei. Is this a multi-nucleated cell.'''


Answer:
```The staining pattern does not typically look like a multinucleated cell, although this hypothesis cannot be excluded. Note that the second nucleus is much smaller and of an unusual shape. Also, it is blurrier than the larger nucleus in that cell. Towards the gap between the two nuclei the DAPI staining fades out. It could be that this is one nucleus that makes a bend in the z direction and thus is off plane where the gap is. Also, it could be that we see in the upper nucleus piece the off-focus signal from a cell in a different plane since the blue staining is slightly blurry there. It is also unusual that the second nucleus is partially outside of the region of the microtubule cytoskeleton. It can be possible that this is a staining artefact and a remnant of a dead cell. Multinucleated cells, in contrast, rather tend to appear with nuclei that are closer to each other and show microtubule structures between the nuclei.```",The cell in the middle right seems to have two nuclei.

```This might be due to the fact that the cell is in an unhealthy state, indicated by the observation that the cell has a fragmented, deformed nucleus. It is possible that this state is, as a consequence, in the progression of apoptosis which might explain why it is not motile and thus does not form filopodia, which are commonly observed in motile cels.```",Why is there barely green staining and filopodia in the cell with the non-round nucleus in the middle right?,"This might be due to the fact that the cell is in an unhealthy state, indicated by the observation that the cell has a fragmented, deformed nucleus.

Question:
'''Why does a staining like this appear? What are the underlying mechanisms?'''


Answer:
```Nuclear speckles self-organize and represent non-membrane-bound compartments found between chromatin regions in the nucleoplasm. Thus they appear in darker regions of a DAPI staining. They generally contribute to gene regulation and as such contain factors involved in splicing, chromatin organization / modification, regulation of transcription, mRNA modification, and mRNA export. Nuclear speckles can be seen as irregular / less-roundish spots inside the nucleoplasm. In interphase, the nucleus contains 20-50 splicing speckles, each measuring up to a few micrometers in diameter. Each speckle is made up of a cluster of many small granules connected by fine fibrils. Paraspeckles vary in size and abundance for different cell types, and can also be induced by various types of cellular stress. They have an elongated shape, with a diameter of about 360 nm and a length of 1-2 micrometers, each made up of small spherical units. ```",Why does a staining like this appear?

Question:
'''What kind of biological functions / mechanisms are conducted in nucleoli?'''


Answer:
```Nucleoli are non-membrane-bound nuclear compartments and responsible for the synthesis, processing, and assembly of ribosomes. They also engage in several other cellular processes, such as stress responses or cell cycle regulation, through sequestration of factors by nucleolar detention. Nucleoli are assembled around nucleolar organizing regions, which localize at rDNA loci along chromosomes. Structurally, the nucleoli consist of three subregions: the fibrillar center where rDNA transcription occurs, the dense fibrillar component where rRNA is modified, and the granular component where ribosomes are assembled. ```",What kind of biological functions / mechanisms are conducted in nucleoli?,"Nucleoli are non-membrane-bound nuclear compartments and responsible for the synthesis, processing, and assembly of ribosomes.

```Dynamic light scattering would reveal whether the distribution of hydrodynamic radius of gyration in solution changes in the presence of the peptide. If the particles are falling apart, the peak(s) in the distribution might disappear (one caveat is that new peaks due to possible aggregation might form, but it is unlikely that these would match the known size ranges of virions). Alternatively, analytical ultracentrifugation might also be informative.```","Beyond microscopy, what biophysical techniques can inform on whether the peptide treatment is degrading the virions?","Dynamic light scattering would reveal whether the distribution of hydrodynamic radius of gyration in solution changes in the presence of the peptide.
